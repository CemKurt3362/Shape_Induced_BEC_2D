Shape-Induced Bose-Einstein Condensation

Introduction

This repository contains the research and simulation files for the "Shape-Induced Bose-Einstein Condensation". 
Shape transformations without altering size, and their influence the thermodynamic properties and condensation behavior of Bose gases are investigated.


Repository Content

Mathematica script for the thermodynamic functions and simulation results (Thermodynamics2DShapeEffects - Thelast.nb)
Simulation Dataset
Figures used in the article 
Eigenvalue calculation scripts for core-shell structure
Polylogarithm approximations of thermodynamic properties for different dimensions


Software: Wolfram Mathematica (version 12.0 or later) is required to run the notebook.
